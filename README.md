myFlix-client is a front end react based web application for interacting with the REST Myflix api I have built earlier in this class. Client is hosted on netlify.

Interaction is handled by the client itself therefore once youve opened the client you are free to interact as described.

Dependencies are as follows
  - Bootstrap
  - React
  - Parcel
